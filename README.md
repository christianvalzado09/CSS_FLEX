This repository, **CSS_FLEX**, features five HTML pages that utilize CSS Flexbox to create responsive layouts for various types of content. These pages include:

- **Employees** (with ID, name, position, and salary)
- **Animals** (with common names, scientific names, types, and sizes)
- **Products** (with ID, name, category, price, and stock)
- **Students** (with ID, name, course, tuition fee, and credits)
- **Actors** (with ID, name, birthday, birthplace, and industry position)

Each page demonstrates how CSS Flexbox improves layout organization and responsiveness, enabling the content to adjust seamlessly across different screen sizes. To explore the project, clone the repository and open the HTML files in your web browser.
